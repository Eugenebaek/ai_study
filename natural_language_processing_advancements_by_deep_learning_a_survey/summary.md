# Natural Language Processing Advancements By Deep Learning: A Survey -- Summary
> "Generally AI is anything a computer can do that formerly was considered a job for a human"


## Background

### Definitions
- Deep Learning: Applying massive amounts of data to deep neural networks for it to learn how to handle a task.
- Feed-Forward Neural Network: A neural network in which the connections between nodes do not create any cycle, i.e., information flows in one direction.

### Deep Learning Architectures
1. Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)

A MLP has at least 3 layers: input, hidden, output. A layer is a collection of neurons which are nodes that transform information. Each neuron in a layer connects to all neurons in the next layer. However, neurons within each layer **do not** communicate with each other. MLPs are a class of FNNs.

2. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
